Description: A comprehensive package for visualizing multi-set intersections and extracting 
    detailed subset information. VennDetail generates high-resolution visualizations including 
    traditional Venn diagrams, Venn-pie plots, and UpSet-style plots. It provides functions to 
    extract and combine subset details with user datasets in various formats. The package is 
    particularly useful for bioinformatics applications but can be used for any multi-set analysis.
